    <p>In English, we say<br>
    how quickly things can change.<br>
    In poetry, we say<br>
    probably friends,<br>
    possibly lovers,<br>
    but definitely not nothing.</p>

    <p>Those were the three thoughts in my mind<br>
    the first time your path crossed mine,<br>
    the first time I met your eyes<br>
    and felt time do that quiet stutter<br>
    it pretends it doesn’t know how to do.</p>

    <p>Then I learned your favorite color.<br>
    Watched how easily you painted a smile<br>
    across my serious disposition.<br>
    I started practicing learning you,<br>
    thinking about you a little too much<br>
    in the margins of my spare time.</p>

    <p>And the three thoughts rearranged themselves.<br>
    Probably lovers,<br>
    possibly friends,<br>
    but definitely not nothing.</p>

    <p>I have a crush on you,<br>
    but not in the modern sense<br>
    where affection is archived<br>
    and measured in taps and lurks.<br>
    I mean in the way I want to record your laugh,<br>
    play it back to God,<br>
    and thank Him on everyone’s behalf.</p>

    <p>I mean in the way that for you,<br>
    I would be put together.<br>
    I would deconstruct my worst habits,<br>
    because for you<br>
    I would want to be better.<br>
    And somehow,<br>
    in doing that,<br>
    I would become better for myself.</p>

    <p>You inspire a new perspective.<br>
    You hold up a mirror and say<br>
    you should really be more perceptive.<br>
    You reflect the best parts of me,<br>
    but make room for the worst,<br>
    improvising as we go,<br>
    because love shouldn’t be rehearsed.</p>

    <p>Those spaces might fill.<br>
    I might not be who you thought.<br>
    I might be someone better<br>
    than the idea you first bought.<br>
    And if you ever had a crush on me,<br>
    the real me,<br>
    I hope you’d grab a journal<br>
    and a fully loaded pen.</p>

    <p>Write me a letter.<br>
    Say,<br>
    I know how this might go,<br>
    but I’m sick of being scared<br>
    of a feeling I really want to know.</p>

    <p>Serendipity, they call it,<br>
    as I write my own letter too,<br>
    to say<br>
    I know how this might go,<br>
    but I have a huge crush on you.</p>

    <p>Only one letter is sent.<br>
    The other stays folded in my chest.</p>

    <p>Because I have a crush on you<br>
    in the running-through-the-airport sort of way.<br>
    The kind that risks embarrassment,<br>
    missed flights,<br>
    and everything unplanned.</p>

    <p class="center">
      That letter is hand delivered.<br>
      And I wouldn’t have it any other way.
